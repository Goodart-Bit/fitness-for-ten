            We’re <strong>Jorge</strong> and <strong>Sydney</strong>, the proud
            owners of <span className="accented-2">Fitness For 10</span> a
            locally owned and operated gym built on passion, perseverance, and
            community. Fitness has been close to our hearts for over a decade,
            but our real journey began shortly after COVID, when we both took
            jobs at this very gym simply as a way to get out of the house. What
            started as “just a job” quickly became something much more. Within
            Jorge’s first month, he stepped into a management role. But it
            wasn’t the title that made this place feel like home it was the
            people. The energy, the stories, and the everyday support, it all
            formed a community that captured our hearts.

          <br />
          <p>
            In 2021, we took a leap of faith and purchased the club with three
            clear goals in mind:
          </p>
          <br />
          <ol>
            <li>
              To create a space where everyone, no matter their fitness level,
              feels <span className="accented">welcome</span>,{" "}
              <span className="accented">supported</span>, and{" "}
              <span className="accented">empowered</span>.
            </li>
            <li>
              To continuously improve our facility, bringing it to the level our
              amazing community truly deserves.
            </li>
            <li>
              And most importantly, to become a{" "}
              <strong>
                gym that gives back and stays deeply connected to our local
                community
              </strong>
              .
